<div class="rec-explanation">
	The client begins by calculating a private/public keypair
	for key exchange.  Key exchange is a mathematic technique
	by which two parties can agree on the same number without
	an eavesdropper being able to tell what that number is.
	<br/><br/>
	It will do this via an elliptical curve method, using the x25519 curve.
	<br/><br/>
	The private key is chosen by selecting an integer between
	0 and 2<sup>256</sup>-1.  It does this by generating 32
	bytes (256 bits) of random data.  The
	<a href="files/client-ephemeral-private.key" download="client-ephemeral-private.key">private key</a>
	selected is:

	The <a href="files/client-ephemeral-public.key" download="client-ephemeral-public.key">public key</a>
	is chosen by multiplying the point x=9 on the x25519 curve
	by the private key.  The public key calculated is:

<div class="rec-explanation">
	The server now has the information to calculate the
	keys used to encrypt the rest of the handshake.  It uses the following
	information in this calculation:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="files/client-ephemeral-public.key">client public key</a> (from Client Hello)
	<li><a href="files/server-ephemeral-private.key">server private key</a> (from Server Key Exchange Generation)
	<li>SHA256 hash of ClientHello and ServerHello</li>
	</ul>
	First, the server finds the shared secret, which is the
	result of the key exchange that allows the client and server
	to agree on a number.  The server multiplies the client's
	public key with the server's private key using the curve25519()
	algorithm.  The 32-byte result is found to be:
	<pre class="ind2"><tt class="longboi">df4a291baa1eb7cfa6934b29b474baad2697e29f1f920dcc77c8a0a088447624</tt></pre>

	I've provided <a href="files/curve25519-mult.c" download="curve25519-mult.c">a tool</a>
	to perform this calculation:
	<codesample>
<pre><code>$ cc -o curve25519-mult curve25519-mult.c
$ ./curve25519-mult server-ephemeral-private.key \
                    client-ephemeral-public.key | hexdump

</code></pre>
	</codesample>

	We then calculate the SHA256 hash of all handshake messages
	to this point (ClientHello and ServerHello).  The hash does
	not include the 5-byte "record" headers.  This "hello_hash"
	is <tt class="longboi">da75ce1139ac80dae4044da932350cf65c97ccc9e33f1e6f7d2d4b18b736ffd5</tt>.
	<br/><br/>

	We then feed the hash and the shared secret into a set of
	key derivation operations, designed to ensure the integrity
	of the handshake process and to protect against known and
	possible attacks:

	<processblock>
<pre>early_secret = HKDF-Extract(
    salt=00,
    key=00...)
empty_hash = SHA256("")
derived_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = early_secret,
    label = "derived",
    context = empty_hash,
    len = 32)
handshake_secret = HKDF-Extract(
    salt = derived_secret,
    key = shared_secret)
client_handshake_traffic_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = handshake_secret,
    label = "c hs traffic",
    context = hello_hash,
    len = 32)
server_handshake_traffic_secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = handshake_secret,
    label = "s hs traffic",
    context = hello_hash,
    len = 32)
client_handshake_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = client_handshake_traffic_secret,
    label = "key",
    context = "",
    len = 16)
server_handshake_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = server_handshake_traffic_secret,
    label = "key",
    context = "",
    len = 16)
client_handshake_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = client_handshake_traffic_secret,
    label = "iv",
    context = "",
    len = 12)
server_handshake_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(
    key = server_handshake_traffic_secret,
    label = "iv",
    context = "",
    len = 12)
</pre>
	</processblock>

	This has introduced two new cryptographic methods:
	<ul>
	<li><tt>HKDF-Extract</tt> - given a salt and some bytes of key material
	create 256 bits (32 bytes) of new key material, with the
	input key material's entropy evenly distributed in the
	output.
	<li><tt>HKDF-Expand-Label</tt> - given the inputs of key
	material, label, and context data, create a new key of the
	requested length.
	</ul>

	I've created <a href="files/hkdf.sh" download="hkdf">an HKDF tool</a>
	to perform these operations on the command line.

			This data is encrypted using the server

			generated during the "Server Handshake Keys
			Calc" step.  The IV will be modified
			by XOR'ing it by the count of records that
			have already been encrypted with this key,
			which in thise case is 0.  The process also
			takes as input the 5-byte record header
			that this record begins with, as authenticated
			data that must match for the decryption to
			succeed.
			<br/><br/>
			Because the <tt>openssl</tt> command line
			tool does not yet support AEAD ciphers,
			I've written command line tools to both

			Because the server is generating ephemeral
			keys for each session (optional in TLS 1.2,
			mandatory in TLS 1.3) the session is not
			inherently tied to the certificate as it
			was in previous versions of TLS, when the
			certificate's public/private key were used
			for key exchange.
			<br/><br/>
			To prove
			that the server owns the server certificate
			(giving the certificate validity in this
			TLS session), it signs a hash of the handshake
			messages using the certificate's private
			key.  The signature can be proven valid by
			the client by using the certificate's public

			Calc" step.  The IV will be modified
			by XOR'ing it by the count of records that
			have already been encrypted with this key,
			which in thise case is 1.  The process also
			takes as input the 5-byte record header
			that this record begins with, as authenticated
			data that must match for the decryption to
			succeed.

			Because the <tt>openssl</tt> command line
			tool does not yet support AEAD ciphers,
